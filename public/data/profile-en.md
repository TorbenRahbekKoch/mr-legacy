{age} year old full stack generalist, system developer, architect and designer 
focusing on C#, .NET, React and TypeScript. 25 years of professional experience since 1997 with a
Master of Computer Science degree from Aarhus University in the back pocket.

I have seen my share of programming languages: Pascal, C++, C#, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript,
TSQL, PL-SQL on top of the more stranger esoteric university languages.

The tools of the trade include Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Git, Azure DevOps, Docker, 
Kubernetes, Delphi, Borland C++ Builder.

UI-frameworks include on the desktop QT, Winforms, WPF (especially on a 2 year assignment for 
Thomas Cook Airlines) – and on the web Bootstrap, AngularJS, ReactJS.

Documentation is a necessity and a joy and have been executed on several levels from meaningful 
naming of methods, classes and parameters through sensible code comments and system
documentation in readme-files to fully fledged wiki-systems with diagrams in Visio and similar 
tools.

I am fully capable of remote work (and like it) and have experienced it to the fullest in my 
assignment at IDA, partly due to covid-19 and partly due to a move cross country, so more than a 
year has been fully remote. With tools like Teams a colleague is never further than a message or a 
call away.

The agile way of working with small steps and frequent feedback on product, process and people is 
fascinating and educational.

With my many years with software architecture, development architecture, operations and 
maintenance (DevOps) I can with stoical calmness call myself experienced, knowledgable, 
committed and efficient, which – combined with a great curiosity and tenacity – drives me towards 
the best solution.

The Mr. Legacy nick name is not just an expression of my age, as much as it is an expression for 
my ability and desire to work with old code. Code with a history.

I am kind person with a sense of humor and irony and on top of that with a professional and 
pragmatic approach to my trade. My work place I consider a place where my primary function is to 
do a job in close cooperation with my colleagues in an informal atmosphere with room for humor 
and personal interests.
