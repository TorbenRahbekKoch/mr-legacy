# A fresh look at your development setup

As I am - admittedly - new to this I will make you an
offer you can't refuse.

I spend 3 days - not necessarily in a row - at your company,
talking to managers, developers, businesspeople and when done,
I will write up my observations and recommendations. This write up
is intended to be readable for everybody involved and I suggest
that everybody actually reads it.

What do I need for you to do this? 

- A high-level view of what you are doing/producing/selling
- A high-level view of how you are approaching this
- A high-level view of how your development organisation is put together

If you are using SCRUM or any other process where you have some kind
of planning session, I would very much like to observe that session.

I also need some volunteers from various teams which I can interview
about their doings in the company. The interview is a safe, anonymous
space. No one is thrown under the bus - I need people to be totally
honest with me.

And the offer you can't refuse? I will do this for the 
very reasonable price of DKK5000.
