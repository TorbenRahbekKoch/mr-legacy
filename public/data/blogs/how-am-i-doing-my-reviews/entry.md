# How am I doing my reviews?

This is written as an answer to the hitherto never asked question: _How am I doing my reviews?_

Firstly I usually read the first few chapters to get an idea of
where the author is going with this. The first results of this is
various underlinings of text I found interesting and imnportant
and scribblings in the margin with my own humorous (I think)
and intelligent (I think) remarks.

## Writing the review

Then I start writing the review, dutifully working my way through
all the chapters, taking into account my underlinings and similar
clever stuff to create an opinionated story about the chapter.

I am still working on my style and will probably over time reformat
some existing posts (and likely fix some typos) as I fixate on
a format I like.

Along the way I add various links which I find interesting and/or
believe to be relevant for the material at hand.

Quotes are collected along the way and added to the blog, as well.

## Summing up

I write an introduction relating who I think the book is for
and end the review with some sort of conclusion summing up
what I think about the book.

## Rating it

Also I give the book a rating from 1 to 5 ⍟ - which is
of course 100% _my_ rating but
I aim to let it show my perceived value of the book for the
audience I believe the book is for.

_Don't read. This book is pure rubbish. There is no way
to salvage it._

I probably would not read all of such a book ;)

_The idea for the book shows some promise, but the execution is
severely lacking. If you like the subjects it may be worth
a read for the few takeaways there is. Just don't expect much._

_Worth reading. Nothing spectacular and the writing
probably won't win any prices, but the subject matter
is treated fairly well._

_Absolutely worth reading. The writing is really good, the
subject matter is taken good care of. You really enjoy
reading it and will probably take it down from the shelf
from time to time simply to leaf through it._

Most really good books will get this rating.

_Spectacular. It would take serious work to make it better, but there
is no real need to. The writing is flawless, the subject matter is
taught in perfect order and perfect portions._

Only rarely will a book get this rating.
