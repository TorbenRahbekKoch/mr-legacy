# The Review

## Preface

A short introduction with the promises of the book.

## Part One: What We Found

### Chapter 1 - Accelerate

_"Business as usual" is no longer enough to remain competitive_.

A lot of companies are turning into software companies and struggle with it, because
_Software and technology are key differentiators for organizations to deliver value to customers and stakeholders_. It has been shown that
_the strategic use of technology explains revenue and productivity gains more than mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and entrepreneurship_.

_The key to successful change is measuring and understanding the right things with a focus on capabilities—not on maturity_.

The authors have in their research _identified 24 key capabilities that drive improvement in software delivery performance and, in turn, organizational performance_.

### Chapter 2 - Measuring Performance

Measuring lines of code is so easy, but really not a good idea. Code is a liability, so
that is bound to go wrong.

Velocity ain't much better and it is not comparable between teams, even though many
have tried.

Some even have the idea to measure utilization, how much of the time available is
spent on "producing" something. Well, math (queue theory) tells us how bad an idea this is.

A successful measure should focus on outcomes, global outcomes, so
teams basically can't compete.

Four measures have been shown to be good for software delivery: delivery lead time
deployment frequency, time to restore service, change fail rate, although only
the first three can be shown to correlate with delivery performance. But
_these results demonstrate that there is no tradeoff between improving performance and achieving higher levels of stability and quality_.

It is also interesting to see that software delivery performance impacts
general organizational performance. One reason is that
_the ability to take an experimental approach to product development is highly correlated with the technical practices that contribute to continuous delivery._

### Chapter 3 - Measuring and Changing Culture

There is often talk about changing the culture in a company but not often are there
any actual actions behind the sentiment.

Surprisingly the authors have _discovered that it is possible to influence and improve culture by implementing DevOps practices._ That is, the tools and methods will actually
change the culture in the company. Who would have thought that:
\*the way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do."

_Lean management, along with a set of other technical practices known collectively as continuous delivery (Humble and Farley 2010), do in fact impact culture_.

But if we want to make sure that we are "improving culture" we need to measure it.

For this the _Westrum model_ is chosen. It divides organizations into
_Pathological_, _bureaucratic_, and _Generative_ organizations.

Westrup also found that _the organizational culture predicts the way information flows through an organization_. Likert-type questions can be used to measure what kind
of organization an organization is and it seems that
_organizations with better information flow function more effectively_.

This fits with the findings in Google:
_who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions_.
