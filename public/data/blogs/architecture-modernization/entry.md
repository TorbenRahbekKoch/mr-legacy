# The Review

## 1. What is architecture modernization?

A classic introduction chapter setting the stage for for the book; what is
architecture modernization? Hint: It's not just updating .NET to the latest
framework. There are of course deep technical aspects about it, but it is also
very much about mindset; in the entire organization.

_Better Value Sooner Safer Happier (Jonathan Smart)_ provides a perfect model
for the value modernization can bring.

_Architecture modernization is a good time to adopt modern product approaches,_
e.g. by using value streams (stream-aligned teams) and dual-track agile.

_Modernization requires short-term compromises for long-term prosperity, which is
why leaders are reluctant to commit._

## 2. Preparing for the journey

What do you need to pack for a safe journey? A change in mindset (to a socio-technical mindset),
leadership support, a compelling business case, patience, upskilling, Conway's lay,
Wardley Mapping, DevOps, are just some of the items in the suit case.

Architecture modernization is an effort that will likely take years, _there is no quick fix_. You
cannot bolt-on modernization. Take the time to talk things through, making everyone aware of
the complex challenges lying ahead. When looking at a multi-year process a month or two used
on discussing and getting alignment is well worth it, because _modernization efforts cannot be
led by a single superhero or even a small group of them._

_If your organization lacks expertise in technical practices, addressing this problem is crucial
before going too far with modernization._

## 3. Business objectives
