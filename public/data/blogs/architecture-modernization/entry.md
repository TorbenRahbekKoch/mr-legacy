# The Review

## 1. What is architecture modernization?

A classic introduction chapter setting the stage for for the book; what is
architecture modernization? Hint: It's not just updating .NET to the latest
framework. There are of course deep technical aspects about it, but it is also
very much about mindset; in the entire organization.

_Better Value Sooner Safer Happier (Jonathan Smart)_ provides a perfect model
for the value modernization can bring.

_Architecture modernization is a good time to adopt modern product approaches,_
e.g. by using value streams (stream-aligned teams) and dual-track agile.

_Modernization requires short-term compromises for long-term prosperity, which is
why leaders are reluctant to commit._

## 2. Preparing for the journey

What do you need to pack for a safe journey? A change in mindset (to a socio-technical mindset),
leadership support, a compelling business case, patience, upskilling, Conway's lay,
Wardley Mapping, DevOps, are just some of the items in the suit case.

Architecture modernization is an effort that will likely take years, _there is no quick fix_. You
cannot bolt-on modernization. Take the time to talk things through, making everyone aware of
the complex challenges lying ahead. When looking at a multi-year process a month or two used
on discussing and getting alignment is well worth it, because _modernization efforts cannot be
led by a single superhero or even a small group of them._

_If your organization lacks expertise in technical practices, addressing this problem is crucial
before going too far with modernization._

## 3. Business objectives

An entire chapter devoted to answering the "Why?".

Justifying an architecture modernization is of course necessary, since that modernization
is not free. But neither is letting things slide.

There may be several reasons for wanting to do an architecture modernization and there
are several sections in the chapter dealing with those:

- Falling behind faster-moving competitors
- Architecture stifling business growth
- Pursuing an exit strategy
- Growth by acquisition
- Poor UX holding the company back
- Inefficient internal tooling and processes
- Improving hiring and retention

An architecture modernization may help (or even be necesssary) the company to grow
no matter which of many growth strategies are used:

- Product development
- Market penetration
- Market development
- Diversification

Clarity of purpose can be obtained by finding the North Star of the company: "The
metric that best captures the core value that your product delivers to customers".
There may be several north stars in the company; different products, projects, divisions
may work with different north stars.

In general a fine chapter helping to find the areas of the architecture that is in most
dire need of modernization.

## 4. Listening and mapping tours

_Starting modernization by listening_ seems like sound advice. Techies (me, myself and I included)
have a tendency to look towards the technical aspects first. But the needs of the customers and
hence the needs of the businuess should dictate how to proceed with a modernization effort, it
at all.

Therefore you need to listen to people, all kinds of people on all levels who may have differing views
on what are the actual needs.

It may be a good idea to establish an architecture modernization enabling team (AMET), who
are in charge of listening and mapping.

The chapter generally covers various aspects of who to choose, how to ask and listen, using
various techniques such as Impact Mapping, Business Model Canvas, Product Vision Board,
and Risk Storming.

Architectural diagrams are necessary for Risk Storming. Using the C4 model is considered
a standard approach.

When talking to people you can choose between highly controlled discussions and totally
unstrucured, ad-hoc discussions - or anything in between. Various type of questions are
considered, too, such as _Choose an emotion_, _Worst possible_, Devil's advocate\_.

Questionnaries/surveys are an effective tool for eliciting responses from many people and
can help choose who to talk to directly.

With interviews and surveys "done" you can start conducting workshops. One particular useful
technique in workshops is _Troika Consulting_ form _Liberating Structures_.

Other useful methods include _The design squiqqle_ and _The double diamond_.

Two excellent examples from real life give some insight into how you can plan actual
workshops.
