I'm reading the [O'Reilly ebook](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/creating-software-with/9798888650219/).

It is written by Ashley Peacock.

# Who is it for?

Anyone who wants an introduction to Mermaid diagramming

# What is it about?

It is more about Mermaid than it is about _Creating Software_.

# The Review

## Introduction

The book will covers uses of [UML](https://www.uml.org/) and [C4](https://c4model.com/)
techniques and using [Mermaid](http://mermaid.js.org/) for drawing diagrams.

## 1. Document Your Domain

A very short introduction to Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The author recommends
Eric Evans' original
[blue book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/)
for learning about DDD. I would instead recommend Vlad Khononov's
[Learning Domain-Driven Design](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/)
which I haven't read myself yet, but it comes highly recommended
and is a far better and lighter introduction to DDD than Eric Evans.

The chapter introduces class diagrams and how to write those in Mermaid. There
was really no need to involve DDD in that.

## 2. Enhance Your Domain Model

How to model inheritance, relationships and multiplicity.

## 3. Visualize Application and User Flows

Sequence diagrams are clearly a strong visual aid for figuring
out flows in an application and Mermaid easily supports those.

## 4. Model Your Architecture

System context, container, component, code - the essential
parts of a C4 model.

The system context has three main elements: people, the
software system, supporting (other) software systems.

This can be modelled surprisingly well by a Mermaid flowchart, which
also supports custom styling of the diagram nodes.

## 5. Detail Your System's Containers

A C4 container is a deployable unit, e.g. a website, a mobile
application, a database.

Again the flowchart is used for modeling and subgraphs are used
for adding clear boundaries. Interactions can be shown as both
synchronous and asynchronous.

Arrows can customized to some degree.

## 6. Structure Your Components and Code

Now we turn to model the overloaded term: Components. In C4
it corresponds to a high-level namespace, module, library
or package. You should probably not model all of these, only
the ones important for getting and overview of the system.

Again flowcharts are used.

The final part of the C4 model is the code diagram where we
zoom in on individual classes. This is not used much and
should be autogenerated from the code, if needed.

## 7. Design Database Schemas

You shouldn't, but if you are using a relational database
you can use the _erDiagram_ diagram type to model it.

You should prefer to instead look at event sourcing
and [Event Modeling](https://eventmodeling.org/) - but of course
you may have inherited a relational database in dire need
of documentation.

The _erDiagram_ of course supports relationships and
multiplicity.

## 8. Visualize Code Flows

Not surprisingly code flows are modeling using the sequence diagram.

## 9. Design and Refactor Your Applications

Before a larger refactoring it may be useful to have a
class diagram to get the lay of the land. Of course a
class diagram is used for this.

You can then alter the class diagram to see how it looks
when you introduce new classes, change relationships and what have you.

It could be valuable to have a tool that exported your
coded classes to a Mermaid-class diagram.

## 10. Render Diagrams Using Native Support

Native Support is here referring to e.g. Github having
support for rendering Mermaid inside Markdown-files.

No matter where your have your Mermaid-code you should try
to ensure that it is automatically kept up-to-date.

## 11. Create a Static Site with Mermaid Diagrams

And example of creating a Github Pages static site
using Jekyll, where Mermaid-code is converted to
images.

## Conclusion

The book should have been titled "Introduction to Mermaid" and focused on
that, because that is what it is. But by trying to be something else
it just becomes a mediocre introduction to Mermaid. There's nothing in the
book that isn't described better on
[the offical Mermaid site](https://mermaid.js.org/). Being fairly short
makes the book earn two stars.
