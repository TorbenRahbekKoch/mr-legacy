# Strategic Monoliths and Microservices - a review

Rating: ⍟⍟⍟⍟◯  

[Vaughn Vernon](https://vaughnvernon.com/) and [Tomasz Jaskula](http://jaskula.fr/) wrote a [book](https://www.informit.com/store/strategic-monoliths-and-microservices-driving-innovation-9780137355464?ranMID=24808). 

I here review the paperback: ISBN-13: 978-0-13-735546-4

## Who is it for?

This is for executives. managers, architects and developers, who might have an interest in "these things", and honestly nowadays almost everybody ought to have some interest in it.

It is not, I think, an exactly easy read. A lot of words are, at times, used. I am a developer and like
conciseness, and the book is in general a bit wordy ;)

## General thoughts about the book

I have some technical challenges with the book. The font used looks like they were constantly just
about to run out of ink. It grows on you, but it another font may have made it easier to read.

The paper is a bit thin, too, which makes the previous/next page slightly visible behind the current page.

At the end of the book is missing a complete list of references. It is so much easier than paging through
to the end of each chapter looking for a reference.

## What is it about

This is not a book about DDD, which given Vernon's history, would have been an easy mistake to do.

The review will work through the book as per my "usual" style and it is worth mentioning that the,
foreword, which is worth a read in itself, is written by none other than (Mary "Lean Development" Poppendieck)
[http://www.poppendieck.com/people.htm].

As any good book it start out with the basics and answers questions like What is *digital transformation*? How does it connect with *business goals*? Why *does software go wrong*?

It talks about the infamous Big Ball of Mud, software debt and entropy, which all are some of the signs
that software has gone wrong.

The case study company is introduced: *NuCoverage Insurance*. Along comes a cursory talk about
communication and knowledge sharing (Conway gets another comeback) and organization structure and hierachies, e.g. the "us versus them"-culture.

And interesting point is made in the sections about "What to do about it":

>*Don't overlook the fact that those involved have already failed to introduce a helpful architecture
into existing systems or allowed a lapse in maintaining the architecture that was already in place.*

This fits like a glove with my comment about needing more clever people in my review of Sam Newman's book.

Furthermore there are some parts about "What" and "Why" which really sounds a lot like
[Impact Mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org/).

The first chapter rounds of with a - much needed - defence for agile, which gets a lot of heat
due to mostly bad implementations. *The Big ball of agile mud?* A *one page agile* is introduced.

When reading chapter 2 it strikes me that a lot of the advice in this book - so far, at least - is
common sense (or it ought to be). The funny thing about common sense, though, is that we need to
have it written down and be reminded about it, again and again, because it seems that the world
somehow opposes common sense. You know: "That would be smart, so you can't".
