I'm reading [the O'Reilly ebook](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-unicorn-project/9781098124175/).

## The review

This is a really good read, although not entirely as good as 
[The Phoenix Project](/blogs/the-phoenix-project). 

The story is generally well-written, although a tighter editing would have done miracles
here and there.

It takes place at the same time as The Phonix Project, but is told from the developers' view, 
especially from one developer, Maxine, who is a really good developer being thrown into
the deep end on The Phoenix Project.

There she together with other employees tackles one obstacle after the other, starting
with just building The Phoenix Project on her own laptop, but "Everything I try to do
requires an email, a ticket, or trying to find someone".

The story progresses quickly over the following months and Erik, who seemingly moonlights 
as a bartender in a local watering hole, participates by mentoring and nudging 
"The Rebellion", a group of developers, qas, and opses who know that the current state of the union really cannot continue for long.

He introduces them to The Five Ideals: 

1. *Locality and Simplicity*
2. *Focus, Flow and Joy*
3. *Improvement of Daily Work*
4. *Psychological Safety*
5. *Customer Focus*

*Improvement of daily work* should be prioritized even over daily work.

Later he introduces the management to the *Three Horizons* and the *Four Zones* - 
where two of them are: *Core versus Context*. *Core* is what the customers are willing to pay for.
*Context* is everything else: Payroll, cafeterias, christmas parties and so on.

This does, of course, sound very much like something Wardley Mapping is quite
suited for uncovering.

Some parts of the story is quite unbelievable. The way they "just like that"
happen to add loads of automated tests to Phoenix is not realistic. 

A piece of code, which they can hardly understand, is suddenly within a couple 
of hours covered with tests and gets magically refactored from 2000 lines to 500. 

These almost magical moments doesn't ruin the basic message of the book, though, although *some* people might use it to exactly undermine that message.

## Interesting tidbits and quotes

*A healthy software system is one that you can change at the speed you need, where people can contribute easily, without jumping through hoops.*

*Each decision is a commitment to support it for years or even decades—these are decisions that go far beyond just one team.*

*Isn’t it absurd that when you build a feature, changes sometimes have to be made by the UI team, the front-end team, the back-end team, and the database team?* 
(And the QA team, the Doc team, the Marketing team, the Support team...)

*Technical debt is what you feel the next time you want to make a change*

*solving problems requires prevention, which requires honesty, and honesty requires the absence of fear*

*It is ignorance that is the mother of all problems, and the only thing that can overcome it is learning*

*a bad system will beat a good person every time*

*For the leader, it no longer means directing and controlling, but guiding, enabling, and removing obstacles*

*When something goes wrong, we ask ‘what caused the problem,’ not ‘who.‘*

*every incident is a learning opportunity, an unplanned investment that was made without our consent*

*Small batch sizes, like in manufacturing, create a smooth flow of work, with no jarring disruptions or catastrophes.*

*what’s the plural of ‘developer’?” says Maxine. “A ‘merge conflict.’"*

*Norm Kerth says in the Agile Prime Directive, ‘Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.’*

*When everyone knows what the goals are, as Erik predicted, teams will self-organize to best achieve those goals*

*Instead we ask whether our daily actions truly improve the lives of our customer, create value for them, and whether they’d pay for it. And if they don’t, maybe we shouldn’t be doing it at all.”*

*If we’re not growing, we’re shrinking*

*the Hoare principle: “There are two ways to write code: write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it, or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it.”*

*Long term, we don’t want to manage our dependencies, we want to eliminate them*

*simplicity enables effectiveness, and that complexity conspires against it*

*think carefully about how each and every position you eliminate might disrupt flow, especially when you don’t have locality in decision-making, as embodied by the First Ideal.*

*Chris has eliminated QA as a separate department, distributing them into the feature teams.*

*Ops is quickly turning into a platform team and internal consultants, with the goal of providing developers the infrastructure they need, complete with a vast army of experts who are there to help, looking for ways to make developers productive.*

*who better to disrupt things for the benefit of customers than the organizations that already have a decades-long relationship with them?*

## The conclusion

Apart from some almost magical leaps on the way the book does a very good job
on describing the many, many benefits - on all levels - of DevOps for an organization.

It might be a bit too long, but still I'll gladly hand out four stars for it.
