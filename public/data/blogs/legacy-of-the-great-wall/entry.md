# Legacy of the great wall 

One day while dismantling (some (tiny part) of) this wall I took a 
(much needed) pause and pondered...

Working with legacy software can be much like
breaking down a wall. Hard, sweaty work for real men and 
you literally have to bang something against it (the wall). I
would advise against using your head for that, in opposition to
when you are working with legacy software, where you very much
have to use your head. Metaphors have their uses but are rarely
perfect.

The dog did not help much apart from pointing to an obvious place
to start: The other end. And, of course, occasionally distracting me with
a ball. An important task for a dog!

Looking for seams and fracture planes is an obvious way to 
explore the software, ehm - wall, to (t)ease the it apart.

I've also heard that it is like eating an elephant (which
nowadays might be considered wildly politically incorrect): One bite
at a time. But it is of course not entirely irrelevant where you start.
If you eat the foot first the elephant might fall down and hurt you 
quite badly. The same thing could happen with some walls! But clearly
you shouldn't run around and eat walls... 

There's probably a zillion metaphors for working with legacy
software. Sometimes it's 
[like reading a book](/blogs/code-encounters-of-the-legacy-kind).
