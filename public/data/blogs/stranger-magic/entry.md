He just couldn’t take his eyes of her, she was petite, cute, with a rather attractive chest, long chestnut hair and eyes that could outshine the sun. He had secretly (as secretly as it can be when he didn’t take his eyes of her) been ogling her for half an hour or so. Contrary to his normal approach, which was to do nothing, he pulled himself and his not entirely bony body together and walked over to her and with a substantial quiver in his voice asked her whether the seat next to her were taken - it obviously wasn’t, nobody else had been there as far as he had seen - but it seemed polite to ask.

She flashed him a smile with both bright white teeth and tantalisingly emerald eyes. It almost knocked him to the floor, due to his knees suddenly malfunctioning. Luckily he managed not very elegantly to turn the fall into an awkward act of sitting down, almost stumbling over her, when she said, “Yes, of course it is… by you now, it seems”.

He intended to throw her his most charming smile, which more became a face combined of shyness and agony as he had hit his knee rather badly.

“My, you are a curious thing, aren’t you?”, she said, still smiling and laughing quietly. Normally he would have interpreted that as a laugh of contempt, but she really didn’t radiate that aura of saturated disregard that he was so used to.
 
“Ehm, thank you?”, he tried. His face slowly returned to just the usual combination of shyness, of which there seemingly can be a substantial and intricate amount.

“You’re welcome!”, she answered, “You did make an impression I must say.” She again flashed him that wonderful smile. He was relieved to be sitting since his knees totally caved in.

“Ehm, yes, I did, didn’t I”, he replied very cleverly. He sort of smiled to her, gave her his hand and said, with a voice that very well could have been helium-induced, “Well, ehm, I’m charmed and ehm, George to meet you.”

She returned his handshake with both hands, holding his hand in a warm and surprisingly firm grasp, “Well, hello charmed, I’m Jennifer”. She tilted her head, letting the hair hang lose, making him utter an exasperated sigh. “So George, what brings you to this rather dull place?”.

“Ehm, I was actually supposed to meet a friend, but he cancelled on me half an hour ago”, he croaked.

“That wasn’t very nice of him, was it? So why are you still here?” She smiled that smile again. Exasperated sigh.

He feverishly tried to think of something not lame to say and after some time just exactly long enough to make it awkward finally succeeded in not finding anything, “Ehm, I think it was about the time you walked in here?”, he ventured, while twisting his face into something vaguely resembling a smile.

“Is that a compliment?”, she asked, tilting her head, smiling that smile, making her impossibly seem even more adorable.

“Did it sound like one?”, he asked questioningly, while, for the first time, daring to look into her beautiful, bright eyes for more than a second. He looked down, feeling stupid and shy. She put her hand under his chin, gently lifting his face up, meeting his eyes, locking them on to her eyes. “Yes, I think it did, coming from you, my curious one. I think it did.”

His mouth went dry, his voice was hoarse, when he asked her, “Do you need something to drink, too?”. She looked at her - to her half full - to him half empty - glass, lifted it up and seemingly examined it carefully just long enough for him to panic in an attempt to break the - to him very awkward - silence. “Sure, why not”, she said in the exact moment where he opened his mouth and expressed his heartfelt opinion on the matter. “Ehm…”, he said. 

She waved at the bartender, pointed at her glass and asked him, “So what does a curious thing like you drink?” She smiled that breathlessness inducing smile.

This really ought to be an easy question, he thought and quickly answered: “Ehm, drink?”. Her eyes twinkled like a twin Venus when she told the bartender to pour him a double vodka with apple juice. “I  think you need something for that cat.”, she said.

“Ehm, cat?”, he asked confused.

“Yup, the cat that’s obviously got your tongue”, she laughed and smiled. Again that smile. He really needed to breathe now. “Oh, that cat…”, he answered and again his face tried quite unsuccessfully to mimic a smile.

The bartender arrived with the drinks. He quickly took a huge sip of it, partly to kill time, partly to quench his thirst and partly to have time to think of something intelligent to say.

“Ehm, so…”, he offered and quickly decided to supercharge his intelligence with another sip.

She looked curiously at him, smiled at him. Took a sip of her drink, her eyes looking intently on him while taking somewhat uncomfortably longer than strictly necessary, causing a panicky feeling to surface again. He tried not to breathe, although he really wasn’t clear on why, but since that sip really took a long time his autonomous nervous system finally decided to overrule his unsubstantiated decision and make him breathe, of course at the same time he decided taking another slurp, which therefore became a somewhat impolitely sounding slurp of his now finished drink. His brain, suddenly feeling competitive, finally managed to squeak into gear.

“Ehm, so what are you doing here?”, he asked confidently while his face far more successfully than before undertook the perilous quest of showing a smile. Her eyes twinkled, while her lips caressed the straw in a way that made certain parts of his clothes fill out in areas that generally was not that well designed for filling out. It showed. In his red face, too.

“Well, honestly. I was sitting at home, feeling bored and lonesome. Needed to kill time. Didn’t think it would be this interesting.”

“Interesting?”, he asked, when it slowly dawned on him that it was him being considered interesting. “Ehm, aaaah, I get it!”, he said. Getting it - and especially any - was not was he was used to.

“I’m glad you got it”, she smiled, “I’m not sure, I did”. This instantly confused the heck out of him again. He tried to focus while at the same time trying to stop his knees from collapsing under him (which of course would not be a big issue right now, since he was in fact sitting). “That damn smile”, he thought to himself and said - totally fearless and without hesitation: “Would you like to get out of here?” He quickly back paddled and added “Ehmm, I mean, I sure could use some fresh air. How about you?”

“Sure, why not”, she smiled to him, which made it quite an effort to get up and follow her. He finally managed to get his knees to collaborate and went outside where she was already waiting for him. “I almost thought you changed your mind. What took you so long?” Her voice had an edge to it, he could not quite deduce what it meant. The alcohol, giving him an edge, wanted him to say something funny along the lines of: “Well, I could say I got lost, but that place isn’t much bigger than a phone booth, so that wouldn’t have fooled you”, but all he managed to get out was: “Ehm, my legs didn’t seem to work right”.

That oddly seemed to put her at ease. She smiled a smile that outshone the full moon, took his hand into hers: “It sounds as if you could use a helping hand”. She was more right than she probably knew and not just about the legs. She started walking slowly and the somewhat alcohol sedated brain of his was not quite able to coordinate the intricate steps it took to follow her, so he almost got an instant membership to the Ministry of Silly walks, but somehow managed to stay just enough upright.

A little way down the road she turned down a path, which had no street lamps and therefore only was lit by the moon and occasionally the flashes from her smile. They walked in silence, a silence that to him was both incredibly awkward and a relief. It seemed to clear his mind to a level where he was finally able to take in what happened, and then his brain in stunned surprise instantly shut down again.

“Ehm”, he uttered. “Do you know where we are going?”

“Shush”, she whispered and smiled, causing him to momentarily stumble, “enjoy it and listen.”

He listened and felt compelled to alert her to the fact that he couldn’t hear anything but their, well, in fact just his own breathing. “Yes, exactly”, she whispered, “not even our own foot steps. Isn’t it magical?”. Agreement came easily to him. He would have agreed to anything she said.

They kept on walking. The air was chilly but he wasn’t cold. A few minutes later he figured out why the air was chilly. The path opened up to a beach, with the waves gently rolling in. He could see the waves, but they sounded as if they were far away. They sat down on a bench, which was conveniently located so they could overlook a part of the beach and the ocean exactly without getting their feet wet.

“Ehm”, he started, “you know, there normally isn’t a beach or even a sea in this city?” He looked at her, somewhat bewildered. “I know”, she answered, “This is the first time I’ve seen a beach here. There’s always something at the end of the path, but I’ve never seen a beach before.”

“But, ehm?”, he asked with a firm conviction.

“I don’t know”, she answered, “and the path doesn’t always lead somewhere strange. Sometimes it just leads into a row of houses. But it's still amazingly fascinating.” He had to agree. Obviously.

They sat for a while, enjoying the silence and the tantalising (he thought) company of each other.

“You’re the first I’ve brought here”, she said.

“But why?”, he asked. Honestly, he had no idea why this honour should befall him.

“It felt as the right thing to do”, she said. “It felt as if you could handle it. Otherwise the path might not have led into anything but the row of houses. I think the path somehow trusts me.”

He sat in silence, looking at the waves, looking at her. Comparing the way the waves rolled and the way her hair waved in the slight breeze. He felt at ease. He felt he was in good hands. She leaned against him, put her head on his shoulder and totally against his nature he put his arm around her. The world seemed perfect in this very moment. He did not dare speak. He did not dare breathing, but nature had its own opinion on that matter and he suddenly breathed rather loudly. She looked up. “Is something wrong?”, she asked.

“Oh, no, not at all”, he smiled, still feeling relaxed and at home. “The beauty of the moment took my breath away”. He wrinkled his forehead in surprise over his unusually eloquent tongue, looked down and into her eyes and smiled. She smiled back. His lower legs appeared to fall off.

Looking out into the horizon, he quietly asked her: “Have you ever, ehm, explored, ehm, the area?”

“Yes, I have. Especially the woods, but they tend to be rather small. All paths leading back to the beginning of the path here”, she answered dreamily.

“Ever met anyone else here?” He looked into her amazing eyes again. She shook her head. “No, it's only ever been me. Up until now, that is.”

“You are truly magical”, he whispered. Her eyes smiled at him. “Yes, I guess I am”, she giggled. He held her tight, wanting the moment to last forever.

A few minutes later she lifted her head, “I’m really sorry”, she said, “but it's getting really late and it seems I have to get up early in the morning.” She looked at him with eyes that would have caused anyone with just the tiniest insight into human behaviour to say: “Can I see you again?” He said it with puppy eyes so full of longing and desire that it would have made anyone say yes. She said yes with a kiss that challenged his knees almost beyond infinity.

Sad, and in a strange way relieved, he silently took her hand and got up. 

They walked along the path in unnatural silence, reached the end of the path, the start of the real world and the silence retreated, paving the way for the normal sounds of the city. “I will see you again”, she kissed. He nodded in silence, watching her walk away and then turned his back on his possibly most exciting adventure ever.
