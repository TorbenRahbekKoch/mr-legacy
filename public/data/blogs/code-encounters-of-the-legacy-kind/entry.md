# Code encounters of the legacy kind

You are excited. Just about to start reading a new book, which - judging from its colorful cover - promises exciting interweaving tales about interesting characters living fascinating lives. It is a rather large book - probably about 2000 pages, but again - judging from the artful cover - it will be a page turner! Thrilled you open the book and start reading.

Page 1.
WTF? Who is this princess? 

Page 2.
WTF? When did the princess die?

Page 389.
Ah. There she died. But who killed her?

Page 681.
She didn't die? 

Page 782.
Which acid head wrote this crap?

After days of hysterical horror you finally finish the book. Or to be honest and truthful; you may have happened to skim very quickly through the last 1300 pages. 

Unfortunately you are expected to write a book report, answering very specific questions like "What color do the princess' eyes have?" and "What is that tatto on her right buttock".

"Easy-peasy", you think. It is after all an eBook (modern times!) so a full-text search will do wonders. You gleefully (and probably somewhat naive) search for "eyes" while the world  watches your spirits (and not the good kind) sink somewhat below knee level when discovering that Buenos Aires seemingly is consistently (at least it is probably consistent) misspelled Buenos Eyes. A case-sensitive search reveals a lot of talk about the eyes, but nothing obvious about their color. Skimming hopelessly through some of the pages you spot that sometimes "eyes" has been misspelled "aies" and "color" varies between at least "color", "colr", "colour" and "clour". After hours of searching you find another character, which you hitherto haven't encountered, happily referring to the "colr of the prince's eies". But that is it. No actual color. And no actual princess. You then look at the cover, which pictures the beautiful princess with dazzling emerald green eyes and write that in your book report. Question 1 done! That quick fix sure felt good and it will definitely never 
come back to bite you!

This is how it can be working with legacy code. A frustrating and sometimes fruitless search for the root cause(s) of a spurious bug. "How hard can it be", the customer asks. "It can be pretty hard.",  you answer and continue:

"Imagine a book with maybe 2000 pages. The author didn't write it in any particular order. He just scribbled something on a random page. When reading it, it feels like reading random notes from a troubled philosopher having a really bad day. Most of it doesn't make any sense on its own. And finding and collecting and remembering the whole context (if it is there at all to begin with) to make it make sense is exceedingly hard; if even possible. "

You ruffle your beautiful Einstein-hair, which you surprisingly haven't entirely lost yet, and continue:

"To fix a bug in this, you must read the book, understand the random notes and connect them to have some context and meaning. And on top of that you must take into account all the knowledge the author did NOT include in the book." (IF you are lucky, there's another book that includes (at least some of) that knowledge...)

"So I cannot tell you how long it takes to fix that bug", you conclude and the customer looks weary-aied at you and walks away throwing a pile of paper he just happened to have in hands up in the air resulting in the pile of paper very much resembling the layout of the code.
