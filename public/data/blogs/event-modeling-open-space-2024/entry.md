# Event Modeling Workshop and Open Space in Berlin 2024

I first heard of Event Modeling in the
[Vaughn Vernon add dot podcast](https://adddot.io/podcast/s2e5/). The
podcast made me curious about this "Event modeling" thing, so
I started following [Adam Dymitruk on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eventmodeling/). Adam can have a way of expressing himself that
can be a little off-putting, but please disregard that. He is on to
something!

Then one day it happened that [Adam would visit Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168237265641537538?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7168237265641537538%29).

From what I had seen and heard so far about Event Modeling I would have to go. So I did! And it was a treat! Filled with passionate
people in a small, growing field. And not just passionate, but smart
people. Seldom have I been in the presence of so many clever and,
at the same time, totally down-to-earth people.

I will not myself try to explain what event modeling is about. Currently I am building out my [Resources page](/pages/resources) with
loads of interesting stuff about event modeling and event sourcing.

But let me say this: Using event modeling makes the development
of line of business applications a mostly solved problem.

You should most definitely look into Event Modeling!
