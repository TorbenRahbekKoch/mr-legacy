I'm reading [the O'Reilly ebook](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/).

Written by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford.

## The review

I cannot believe I've postponed reading this for so long. What a riveting read!

Since this more reads like a novel I'm not going to go through this chapter by chapter.

It's the story of poor *Parts Unlimited*-employee Bill who suddenly unwillingly lands in the perfect storm: The
Phoenix Project - the death march project which has lasted for ever and ever and costed
large sums of money with no return of value so far.

The organization has problems on all levels. Bill's laptop is broken and he gets
a loaner - a duct-taped relic from quite some time ago. The procedures to get a new one
are so convoluted that it'll take weeks.

Everything is drowning in red (probably duct) tape, webs of bureacrazy and Change 
Advisory Boards and the fun continues. 
Filling out tickets is an ordeal of almost unimaginable magnitude with loads of required, but
at least totally not understandable, fields.

Bill gets mentored by Erik, who knows stuff. E.g. about the Three Ways: 1: fast-flow of 
work from Development into IT Operations. 2: Shorten and amplify feedback loops. 
3: Create a culture of experimentation and learning from failure.

There's more to it than that, of course. The Three Ways are the what. The book is
about the how. 

There's constraint theory, there's value streams, there's work in progress, there's Kanban boards. There would have been Wardley Map had the book been written recently.

To increase flow you need to remove (or diminish) your constraints.

1. Identify the constraint
2. Exploit the constraint - don't let it waste time
3. Subordinate the constraint 

Especially 3 is important. You must manage and plan around the constraint
to maximize the utilization of the constraint. Kanban-boards can be very 
valuable for this, since they show Work in Progress and where the 
hold-ups are. Too much work in progress causes a lot of context switching
which we know are among the causes for burn-out.

"The Theory of Constraints" talks about the Drum-Buffer-Rope scheduling
and execution method. Look it up. It describes how to schedule work 
so the constraint is not overwhelmed.

There are literal disasters, as when management pressures (or rather orders) the
organization to release *The Phoenix Project* in a short while, even though it is 
clearly not in any releasable state and haven't even been released properly before.

With the help of Erik, Bill figures out the important four types of work: 

- Business projects
- Internal projects
- Changes
- Unplanned work

Unplanned work is what ruins everything. It breaks flow, it breaks plans, it
breaks everything. It kills your ability to do planned work. You need to figure out where it comes from and plug the hole.

One essential constraint Bill discovers is Brent, who has been in the company for ages
and knows just about everything there is to know about everything and is therefore
called upon for just about any task needed to be done.

In this he also discovers the difference between *a worker* and a *work center*, 
because *Brent is probably a worker supporting way too many work centers. Which is why he’s a constraint.*

That's why *when Brent takes a vacation, all sorts of work will just grind to a halt, because only Brent knows how to complete certain steps—steps that probably only Brent even knew existed.*

The solution is to standardize and document the work Brent does so more people can
execute that work.

In chapter there's a (probably famous) graph that shows how queue
wait time increasesd when resources utilization rises. This starts to go
really badly when utilization gets to around 80%.

*What that graph says is that everyone needs idle time, or slack time. If no one has slack time, WIP gets stuck in the system. Or more specifically, stuck in queues, just waiting.*



## Golden nuggets

*ensure that your most constrained resources are doing only the work that serves the goal of the entire system, not just one silo*

*The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into IT Operations, because that’s what’s between the business and the customer. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework. And the Third Way shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery*

*Unlike the other categories of work, unplanned work is recovery work, which almost always takes you away from your goals. That’s why it’s so important to know where your unplanned work is coming from*

*Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint - or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized.*

*unplanned work kills your ability to do planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it*

*Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system. To do that, you need to know what matters to the achievement of the business objectives, whether it’s projects, operations, strategy, compliance with laws and regulations, security, or whatever*

*outcomes are what matter—not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete*

*IT is not just a department. IT is a competency that we need to gain as an entire company*

*Left unchecked, technical debt will ensure that the only work that gets done is unplanned work!”*

*Unplanned work has another side effect. When you spend all your time firefighting, there’s little time or energy left for planning. When all you do is react, there’s not enough time to do the hard mental work of figuring out whether you can accept new work. So, more projects are crammed onto the plate, with fewer cycles available to each one, which means more bad multitasking, more escalations from poor code, which mean more shortcuts. As Bill said, ‘around and around we go.’ It’s the IT capacity death spiral*

*saying no just based on your gut is not enough*

*In order to control this system, we need to reduce the number of moving parts”

*Everyone knows that in manufacturing, as WIP increases, due-date performance goes down*

*Brent is probably a worker supporting way too many work centers. Which is why he’s a constraint”

*every work center is made up of four things: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures*

*Properly elevating preventive work is at the heart of programs like Total Productive Maintenance, which has been embraced by the Lean Community.*

*Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work*

*Mike Rother says that it almost doesn’t matter what you improve, as long as you’re improving something. Why? Because if you are not improving, entropy guarantees that you are actually getting worse, which ensures that there is no path to zero errors, zero work-related accidents, and zero loss*

*Rother calls this the Improvement Kata*

*repetition creates habits*

*Just as important as throttling the release of work is managing the handoffs*

*A critical part of the Second Way is making wait times visible, so you know when your work spends days sitting in someone’s queue—or worse, when work has to go backward, because it doesn’t have all the parts or requires rework*

*If it’s not on the kanban board, it won’t get done*

*You’d be amazed at how fast work is getting completed, because we’re limiting the work in process.*

On systems thinking - *confirming that the entire organization achieves its goal, not just one part of it*:

- Are we competitive?
- Understanding customer needs and wants: Do we know what to build?
- Product portfolio: Do we have the right products?
- R&D effectiveness: Can we build it effectively?
- Time to market: Can we ship it soon enough to matter?
- Sales pipeline: Can we convert products to interested prospects?
- Are we effective?
- Customer on-time delivery: Are customers getting what we promised them?
- Customer retention: Are we gaining or losing customers?
- Sales forecast accuracy: Can we factor this into our sales planning process?

*you must leave the realm of IT to discover where the business relies on IT to achieve its goals*

*People think that just because IT doesn’t use motor oil and carry physical packages that it doesn’t need preventive maintenance*

*By showing how IT risks jeopardize business performance measures, you can start making better business decisions*

*We need short and quick cycle times to continually integrate feedback from the marketplace*

*The longer the product development cycle, the longer the company capital is locked up and not giving us a return*

*When R&D capital is locked up as WIP for more than a year, not returning cash back to the business, it becomes almost impossible to pay back the business*

*The need to continually reduce cycle times is part of the First Way*

*It seems to me that if anyone is managing IT without talking about the Three Ways, they are managing IT on dangerously faulty assumptions*

*...master the Second Way, creating constant feedback loops from IT Operations back into Development, designing quality into the product at the earliest stages*

*In any system of work, the theoretical ideal is single-piece flow, which maximizes throughput and minimizes variance. You get there by continually reducing batch sizes*

*the goal is single-piece flow”

*They look at the entire flow of work, identify where the constraints are, and use every possible technology and bit of process knowledge they have to ensure work is performed effectively and efficiently. They harness their ‘inner-Allspaw.’*

*we have a measure called takt time, which is the cycle time needed in order to keep up with customer demand. If any operation in the flow of work takes longer than the takt time, you will not be able to keep up with customer demand*

*As part of the Second Way, you need to create a feedback loop that goes all the way back to the earliest parts of product definition, design, and development*

*You’ve got to figure out how to decrease your changeover time and enable faster deployment cycle time*

*until code is in production, no value is actually being generated*

*You need a deployment pipeline where you can create test and production environments, and then deploy code into them, entirely on-demand*

*Get humans out of the deployment business*

*Business agility is not just about raw speed. It’s about how good you are at detecting and responding to changes in the market and being able to take larger and more calculated risks.*

*If you can’t out-experiment and beat your competitors in time to market and agility, you are sunk. Features are always a gamble. If you’re lucky, ten percent will get the desired benefits. So the faster you can get those features to market and test them, the better off you’ll be. Incidentally, you also pay back the business faster for the use of capital, which means the business starts making money faster, too*

*Because the batch size is so much smaller, we can make small changes very quickly. We’re now doing A/B testing all the time.*

*IT is not merely a department. Instead, it’s pervasive, like electricity* (It's 
commodity, in Wardley Mapping terms)

*In ten years, I’m certain every COO worth their salt will have come from IT*

*to effectively manage IT is not only a critical competency but a significant predictor of company performance*

*DevOps does require many IT Operations tasks to become self-service*

*DevOps is how any horse can became a unicorn*

*Many practitioners believe that kanbans are one of the most effective countermeasures, as well as the simplest*

# Conclusion

Apart from the fact that the book reads like a novel and - for me, at least - is
quite a page-turner, it is also a book with a considerable amount of golden
nuggets.

One can argue that in this day and age all this is well-known. And it should be. The 
book was released in 2013, but there's still a long way to go in the companies of
today.

I will totally agree with other reviews which argue that if you're are in any way
take part in software development, you must read this book.

Even though the book is fairly old it is still very much valid. For this I give
it 5 stars.
