I'm reading [the O'Reilly ebook](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/).

Written by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford.

## The review

I cannot believe I've postponed reading this for so long. What a riveting read!

Since this more reads like a novel I'm not going to go through this chapter by chapter.

It's the story of poor Bill who suddenly unwillingly lands in the perfect storm: The
Phoenix Project - the death march project which has lasted for ever and ever and costed
large sums of money.

Bill gets mentored by Eric, who knows stuff. E.g. about the Three Ways: 1: fast-flow of 
work from Development into IT Operations. 2: Shorten and amplify feedback loops. 
3: Create a culture of experimentation and learning from failure.

There's more to it than that, of course. The Three Ways are the what. The book is
about the how. 

There's constraint theory, there's value streams, there would have been Wardley
Mapping had the book been written recently.

# Conclusion

Apart from the fact that the book reads like a novel and - for me, at least - is
quite a page-turner, it is also a book with a considerable amount of golden
nuggets.

One can argue that in this day an age all this is well-known. And it should be. The 
book was released in 2013, but there's still a long way to go in the companies of
today.

I will totally agree with other reviews which argue that if you're are in any way
take part in software development, you must read this book.

Even though the book is fairly old it is still very much valid. For this I give
it 5 stars.
