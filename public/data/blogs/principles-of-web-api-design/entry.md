**Rating**

I have a hard time getting through this book, so I will share it as I go along.
It is a long time since I've started it.

# Who is it for?

Anyone on a team working actively with designing Web APIs will benefit from
reading this book.

# What is it about?

The premise of the book is that an API is just as strategic a product
as the product(s) it is an API for. It is a product in it's own right.

# The Review

## Chapter 1

Chapter 1 lays the foundation by talking about business capabilities,
product thinking, developer experience (as opposed to user experience).

Old, but relevant as evert, concepts like modularization, encapsulation,
cohesion and coupling is taken out of the stables for a quick trot around
the track.

Rounding of the chapter is a listing of 5 principles of Web API design
which is then covered throughout the rest of the book.

## Chapter 2

Chapter 2 talks about the importance of an API Design-First approach
and using concepts from Domain Driven Design such as Event Storming
James introduces his enhanced, seven-step, iterative proces: ADDR - Align, Define, Design, Refine.

## Chapter 3

The first step: _Identify Digital Capabilities_ is covered in chapter 3
of the same name. James leads us towards [Jobs to be done](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/jobs-to-be-done/) and Job Stories as a method
for figuring out the capabilities and API should support.

James opens up a new shop: JSON's Bookstore, which is then used as an
example for the ADDR-process around the book.

## Chapter 4

Not surprisingly chapter 4 moves on to the next step: _Capture Activities and Steps_. In here he pulls _[Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/)_
out of the pocket. The ADDR process modifies it a bit and a thorough walk-through of how a faciliator might get the best out of the participants, even
in a remote setup, is presented.

It really underlines how important communication is in design. Not just
API design.

## Chapter 5

At this time you will not be astonished by the fact that chapter 5
is about step 3: _Identify API Boundaries_. The word boundary
of course suggests that James again is lent a hand from DDD in the form
of _[Bounded Context](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/bounded-context/)_.
