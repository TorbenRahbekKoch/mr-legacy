# Domain-Driven Design - Concepts

*This blog post was [originally posted on my company website](https://softwarepassion.eu/domain-driven-design-concepts/)*, which is why the publish date
is before this website was created

It is here reposted as it was
with only a few additions, highlights, clarifications and corrections of typos.*

Last week I attended the *IDDD Tour* (Implementing Domain-Driven Design) held by TigerTeam and [Vaughn Vernon](https://vaughnvernon.com/). I like to do mind maps when I’m at these kinds of events. It helps me to get an overview of the subject and is a good help for reviewing after the event. I therefore tried to create a mind map of the various DDD concepts and how they are related, which I hope can be of use to others.

You will need the book [Implementing Domain-Driven Design](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-domain-driven-design/9780133039900/) by Vaughn Vernon, which is a good book, to make sense of the concepts here (or you could google your way through).

July 8th 2013: Updated map – using [MindMup](https://www.mindmup.com/). Added a few more concepts.
